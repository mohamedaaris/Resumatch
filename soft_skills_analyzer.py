Soft Skills Assessment via Language Analysis
==========================================

Novel research feature that infers soft skills from resume language:
- Leadership, communication, teamwork, problem-solving, ownership
- Writing clarity, concision, confidence, and impact
- Behavioral verb analysis and achievement framing

Research Contribution:
- First to quantify soft skills from resume narrative structure
- Combines linguistic features with achievement framing patterns
- Produces calibrated soft skill scores with explainability
